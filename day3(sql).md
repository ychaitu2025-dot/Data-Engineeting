**Relational Databases and MySQL Fundamentals**

**Types of Data in RDBMS Relational databases are primarily architected for** 
**Structured Data, though data engineers must understand the broader spectrum:**

**•	Structured Data:** Highly organized into rows and columns with a rigid, predefined schema. This is the native format for SQL databases.

**•	Semi-Structured Data:** Contains organizational properties but lacks a fixed schema. It utilizes key-value pairs (e.g., JSON, XML).

**•	Unstructured Data:** Has no internal format and is difficult to query directly (e.g., media files, PDFs).

**Database and SQL Overview**

**•	Database:** A structured repository managed by a Database Management System (DBMS). It ensures data integrity, secure access, and efficient retrieval.

**•	SQL (Structured Query Language)**: The standard communication interface for databases. It is a declarative language used to define structures and manipulate data, but it does not store the data itself.

**The Database Schema** a schema acts as a logical container (similar to a folder) for database objects. Core objects include:

**•	Tables:** The primary storage units for data.

**•	Views:** Virtual tables generated by stored queries.

**•	Stored Procedures**: Reusable blocks of SQL logic.

**•	Functions**: Logic designed to return a specific single value.

**SQL Command Categories** SQL operations are classified into five functional groups:

**Data Integrity:** Keys and Constraints constraints are business rules applied at the database level to ensure data quality:

**•	Primary Key:** A unique identifier for every row. It cannot be NULL and must be unique.

**•	Foreign Key:** A column that creates a link to a Primary Key in another table, enforcing Referential Integrity.

**•	NULL vs. NOT NULL:** NULL represents unknown or missing data. NOT NULL forces a column to contain a value.

**•	UNIQUE:** Ensures all values in a column are distinct.

**•	CHECK:** Validates that data meets a specific condition (e.g., Age >= 18).

**•	DEFAULT:** Automatically assigns a value if none is provided during an insert.

**Table Relationships and Referential Actions**

**In a Parent-Child Relationship,** the child table depends on the master data in the parent table. To maintain integrity during deletions or updates, referential actions are used:

**•	RESTRICT**: Blocks the deletion of a parent record if a corresponding child record exists.

**•	CASCADE:** Automatically deletes or updates child records when the parent record is modified.

**Administrative Inspection and Management**

**•	information_schema:** A built-in system database containing metadata. It is used to audit table structures, constraints, and column details.

**•	Safe Mode:** A security setting in MySQL that prevents global UPDATE or DELETE operations. It mandates the use of a WHERE clause involving a Key column.
